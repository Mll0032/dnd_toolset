            Deep within the ruins of an ancient dungeon, a being of arcane brilliance slumbers—<strong>Invar</strong>,
            the last of the Elven Item Historians. Once mortal, Invar's insatiable thirst for knowledge led him to the 
            forbidden halls of the Evervault, a sanctum of magical artifacts and forbidden relics. Betrayed by his own 
            insatiable fascination for items.
            He was shackled to the vault by the dungeons insane inhabitants as its eternal guardian, Invar was transformed into a <strong>magical construct</strong>, 
            bound to document every item of power that exists across the realms.

            For centuries, Invar remained imprisoned, his form pulsing with a dim, violet glow—a mere whisper of the scholar he once was.
            That was until <strong>a band of adventurers</strong>—a warrior monk, a twilight cleric, a cunning thief, and a warlock bound by eldritch oaths—
            discovered the dungeon and broke the arcane chains that held him captive. Now free, Invar continues his life's work, 
            chronicling the magical artifacts of the world so that none may be forgotten.
