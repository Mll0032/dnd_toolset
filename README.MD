## 📜 Story Background
For centuries, **Invar** remained imprisoned in the Evervault, bound by runic magic, his only purpose to document the magical artifacts hidden within. Until one day, **a party of adventurers**—a Warrior Monk, a Twilight Cleric, a cunning Thief, and an Eldritch Warlock—discovered his prison and freed him. Now, Invar continues his work, documenting the vast collection of relics from across the realms.
